    - Validate=true # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=false') ( true by default ).

    - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation # Only sync out-of-sync resources, rather than applying every object in the application
